Right now, I'm knee-deep in Stephen King's Pet Sematary and before that, I was listening to Eleanor Roosevelt autobiography."

              description="When it comes to keeping my digital life in check, I'm all about saving, categorizing, and backing up my stuff on OneDrive. Setting goals and timelines for myself keeps me on track. For example back in early 2023, I splurged on building my own PCâ€”it was a pricey and time-consuming endeavor, but totally worth it for me personally."
